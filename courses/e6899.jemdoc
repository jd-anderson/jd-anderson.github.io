== Overview
This graduate-level topics course will introduce students to the mathematical foundations of modeling, control, and analysis of networked dynamical systems (otherwise known as multi-agent systems). We will investigate how dynamical systems interact with each other over a network, and how such systems can be analyzed and controlled, in particular how the network structure affects achievable performance. One of the central aims of the course is to understand and prove fundamental properties about multi-agent systems. As such, our focus will be on simple (but informative) models that we can concisely reason and construct rigorous statements about.

Classes will be a mixture of instructor-led lectures, student presentations, and discussions. Assessment will be via paper presentations and a class project (more details below).

== Schedule
This schedule is subject to change. Note there is no class on March 17th \& 19th. 

The papers referenced can be found [Reading_list_v1.0.pdf *here*]. In some cases, two papers are listed, the first paper will provide the necessary background for the second paper (which is the paper being presented). Pdfs of the papers are also available on Courseworks. If you are presenting a paper and would prefer that we prepare for your presentation by reading a different paper, let me know and I'll update the details below.

== Course organization

=== Prerequisites
There are no specific course prerequisites for this class beyond mathematical maturity. Students will be expected to read, understand, and present mathematical proofs.  A strong working knowledge of linear algebra and calculus will be assumed. Previous classes in control (linear systems theory) and convex optimization would be helpful but are not necessary. *Undergraduate students will require instructor's permission.*

As a guide to determining whether you have the appropriate mathematical background, download the following documents:
- [lin_alg_basics.pdf Linear algebra review]
- [http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/books/AM08/pdf/fbs-linsys_11Aug2019.pdf Linear dynamical systems review]

The content of the linear algebra notes should be familiar to you. Some of the dynamical systems material may be new, but you should find this straightforward to follow. After the second class it will be taken for granted that this material is known and understood.



=== Class structure
During the first few weeks of class the instructor will cover the necessary background material on dynamical systems, graph theory, and optimization. For each of the core theoretical topics (listed above), the instructor will teach one class, following which there will be student-driven lectures based on paper presentations and class discussions. The remainder of the time will be spent on student-chosen applications that link to the previously studied theory.



=== Grading
Grading will be based on three components:
- Class participation (10%)
- Paper presentation (30%)
- [project_guidelines.pdf Course project] (60%)

== *\#* Possible topics
- *Oscillator synchronization *
-- Nonlinear dynamics
-- Kuramoto oscillators

-  *Learning dynamic models from data (Sys ID)*
-- Subspace identification

-  *Provable safety*
-- Barrier certificates

-  *Cyber-physical systems*
-- Control of power grids
-- Optimal power flow

-- /student--selected topics.../

- *Misc*
-- Social networks
-- Crowd movement
-- Distributed optimization
-- Privacy
-- /student--selected topics.../
